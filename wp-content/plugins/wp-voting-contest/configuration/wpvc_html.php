			Custom questions are much like building a contact form within the contest plugin. You can add questions to the registration form when a user registers to your website or the contestant form when a user enters your contest. Using the Contestants fields, you can ask private information such as phone number or email address and choose not to display those details on the front end contestants page, keeping the details private for the admin to view on the contestants admin page only.
